			<p> Just a few weeks back Lithuania unveiled pedestrian crossing signals featuring women to mark the 100th year anniversary of female suffrage. We’ve come a long way but there’s still more to do to make sure women are truly treated equally. Lithuanian Parliament Seimas remains overwhelmingly male, with only 25% female representatives. At the current rate, we would need another 100 years to balance it out. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius noted, “Modern society does not exist without fully empowered women, yet globally all of us are still halfway on this journey.” Sadly, the lack of women representation in parliaments is the case in most countries. </p>

			<p> This inspired me to create a D3 map representation of female parliament representation that would let a user explore the most recent data on female representation parliament   article headlines related to women equality and governmental representation in any given country. Through this project, I attempted to provide a user quick means to visualize the lack of women representation in the parliaments and make them aware of certain potential issues. The website attempts to provide a user with a snapshot of the situation of women in parliaments worldwide. </p>
