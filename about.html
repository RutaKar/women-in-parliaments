			<h1 id="title"> WOMEN IN PARLIAMENTS</h1>

			<p> Just a few weeks back Lithuania unveiling pedestrian crossing signals featuring women to mark the 100th year anniversary of female suffrage. We’ve come a long way but there’s still more to do to make sure women are truly treated equally. Parliament Seimas remains overwhelmingly male, with only 25% female representatives. At the current rate, we would need another 100 years to balance it out. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius noted, “Modern society does not exist without fully empowered women, yet globally all of us are still halfway on this journey.” Sadly, the lack of women representation in parliaments is the case in most countries. </p>

			<p> This inspired me to create a D3 map representation of female parliament representation that would let a user explore the most recent data on female representation parliament and provide article headlines related to women equality and governmental representation in any given country. Through this project, I attempted to provide a user quick means to visualize the lack of women representation in the parliaments and make them aware of certain potential issues that appear in the news information box.  The website attempts to provide a user with a snapshot of the situation of women in parliaments worldwide. </p>

			<p> For the format of our presentation, we decided to create an interactive online game in light of today’s incredibly digitalized world as well as in line with our proposed solutions which include digital aspects. In the game, we have built out a pathway through which the female character explores the Young Women Challenge, including the context, problem, and solutions represented by carefully-chosen objects. Along the way, she can collect Deloitte icons that symbolize the necessary skills and experiences for her to succeed at the company; the collection of all icons reveals an encouraging message. </p>

			<p> Jannet Murray analyzes four different properties, encyclopedic, participatory, procedural and spatial that constitute our design space and choices. Jannet Murray refers to procedural property for something that is composed of executable rules, participatory to human action and ability to manipulate the digitally represented space, whereas encyclopedic refers to the high capacity of information in multiple media formats and spatial an ability to navigate a virtual space whilst attaining information. When it comes to the procedural property, my project mostly relates to spatial, encyclopedic and participatory affordances. When it comes to spatial affordances, my project allows the user to explore and interact with the world map attaining different types of information through media on gender equality issues and statistics on women representation in parliaments worldwide. These two means of representing information also simultaneously refer to the encyclopedic affordance – I provide the user with the means to explore the high capacity of information in multiple formats, i.e. world map and the media article links and titles. The project also relates to the participatory affordance as it allows the user to interact with the digitally created space.  </p>
